For this assignment I created a weather dashboard and application using third party API OpenWeather app

This application will allow the user to input a city in the search button and then see displayed the current weather of the city and a five day forecast below. The user will be able to search for multiple cities and have past searches stored and available to return to. 

This application is currently not working. When adding in the last api search for the five day forecast the application stopped displaying the current city weather and past display. 

Below are screen shots of what was working until last AJAX call was made.
